CLI Usage
=========

The following examples assume your infrastructure-as-code project is a Python module named ``myproject``.

Preview
-------

To preview the changes that a stack set *would* deploy, pass the stack set key and ``--preview`` arguments:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m myproject app --preview

.. code-block:: text

    ðŸŒ„ Starting DatabaseStackâ€¦
    ðŸŒ„ Starting LoggingStackâ€¦

    ðŸŒž Stack Database in us-east-1

    No changes to apply.

    ðŸŒž Stack Logging in us-east-1

    No changes to apply.

    ðŸŒž Stack Application in us-east-1

    InstanceType = t2.large

    Template changes:
    Description: Application  =  Description: Application
    Parameters:               =  Parameters:
      InstanceType:           =    InstanceType:
        Type: String          =      Type: String
    Resources:                =  Resources:
                              >    ExampleResource:
                              >      Properties:
                              >        InstanceType:
                              >          Ref: InstanceType

    Logical ID       Physical ID    Resource Type           Action
    ExampleResource                 AWS::Example::Resource  Add

    ðŸ¥³ Done!

Execute
-------

To deploy a stack set's changes, pass the stack set key and ``--execute`` arguments:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m myproject app --execute

.. code-block:: text

    ðŸŒ„ Starting DatabaseStackâ€¦
    ðŸŒ„ Starting LoggingStackâ€¦

    ðŸŒž Stack Database in us-east-1

    No changes to apply.

    ðŸŒž Stack Logging in us-east-1

    No changes to apply.

    ðŸŒž Stack Application in us-east-1

    InstanceType = t2.large

    Executed successfully! ðŸŽ‰

    ðŸ¥³ Done!


Note that you can pass both ``--execute`` and ``--preview`` to generated a detailed log of the changes that a deployment performed.

Running in CI
-------------

Smokestack can decide whether to execute or preview your changes based on the Git branch when running in a CI pipeline.

In your deployment directory, create ``smokestack-ci.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    branch_name_env: CIRCLE_BRANCH

    rules:
      - branch: main
        preview: true
        execute: true

    default:
      preview: true
      execute: false

``branch_name_env`` describes the name of the environment variable where the current branch name can be read. This name will depend on your CI providers. In CircleCI, for example, the branch name is recorded in ``CIRCLE_BRANCH``.

``rules`` describes what to do for each branch.

``default`` describes what to do if none of the above rules matched the current branch.

Logging
-------

To emit debug logs, pass ``--log-level debug``.
